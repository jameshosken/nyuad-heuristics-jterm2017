Walkthrough:
	
	Here's one way the computer can find out the number:
		1) Pick a number between the lowest possible (1) and the highest possible (1000). Is it correct? If yes, WIN! If no, move to 2)
		2) Ask if the number is greater than or less than the guess. If greater than, go to 3. Else if less than, go to 4.
		3) Pick a new number between the lowest possible (now the previous guess) and the highest possble (still 1000). Repeat steps above
		4) Pick a new number between the lowest possible (still 1) and the highest possble (now the previous guess). Repeat steps above


	

	So, how do we implement that?

	- We need a variable to store the current highest possible (at first 1000), and the current lowest possible (at first 0)
	- We need an input to say whether the guess is higher, lower or equal.
	- We need a series of if statements to modify the higher/lower values as needed.
	- We need a loop system to repeat until the guess is correct.
