## Rock, Paper, Scissors:

1. Create a game where 2 players enter 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' and determine which player won that round.

2. Keep a list of who has won each round.

#### Hints:
	
+ This challenge puts together variables, inputs and while loops

+ Before starting to code, think about the overall structure of the game. Draw it out on paper, even. what are the 'key points' of the game?
  - User input?
  - Evaluating which player won this round?
  - Keep them playing until one player wins three rounds? That involves keeping track of score.

+ If the overall project is daunting, a good way to approach it is to break it up into small, separate, manageable tasks.
- How would you set up user input mechanism on its own?
- How would you set up the logic of the game, without any other functionality?
- How would you create something that repeats until a certain condition is met?


+ The logic of this game may require a lot of if statements. Think about how many combinations of answers there could be (i.e. "Rock and Rock" or "Rock and Scissors" etc) and how best to evaluate them all.
