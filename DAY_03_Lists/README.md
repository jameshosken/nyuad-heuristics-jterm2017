## Content Review
1. "Casting" integers to strings and strings to integers
2. Handling input errors that might occur with `try` and `catch`
3. While Loops
  - Run until told to stop, as opposed to a `for loop` which has a finite number of iterations
  - Requires an 'end case' or will run forever.
  - Useful for, amongst other things, data entry systems (both for data validation and entering an unknown quantity of data).
