Best Change Challenge:

How can a given amount of money be made with the least number of coins of given denominations 
	
Let's break it down. You will be given 2 things: 

	1) A list of 3 coins of certain denominations (e.g. 1c,5c,10c)
	2) A certain amount of money.
	
Goal: You have to figure out how to get to that amount using the least number of coins.
	
Go.


Hints:

Stuck on where to start?

One solution looks at the highest possible coin value that can fit into the number, and uses it.
If there's still change left, it tries again.
