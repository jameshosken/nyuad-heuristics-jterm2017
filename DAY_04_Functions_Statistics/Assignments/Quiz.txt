Day 04 Challenges:

	1.1) For Loops:
		1.1.1) Print out numbers from 5 to 100

		1.1.2) Print out EVEN numbers from 5 - 100

		1.1.3) Ask user for a number. Print out from 0 to that number.

	1.2) While loops:
		1.2.1) 	Set up a while loop that keeps 
				asking the user to input numbers. 
				Keep a running total of the numbers (i.e. add them up).
				When the user enters the number -1, end the loop and then print the final total.

	3) Lists:
		3.1) Write a list [item1, item2, etc] of the planets, and print each one individually (on a new line).

		3.2) 	
			Write a list of numbers.
			Find the average of the list.
			Print out all the numbers higher than the average.

	4) Files

		4.1)

		PlanetName:Description.
