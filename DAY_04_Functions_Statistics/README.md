## Content Review

1. Lists
  - Identified by `[]`
  - Can contain anything (pro tip: even other lists!)
  - **Value** means the actual thing contained in the list, **index** means that thing's place in the list.
  - You can `append`, `remove`, `pop`, `count`, reverse (`[::-1]`), sort (`sorted(list)`), access any item (`list[index]`), and find the length of the list (`len(list)`)
